# Stable Diffusion 1.5 + Controlnet Template Cog model

[![Replicate](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/badge)](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion) 

This is an implementation of the [Diffusers Stable Diffusion v1.5](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) with [ControlNet for 1.5](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet) as a template model for Replicate's DreamBooth API. 

- [Cog packages machine learning models as standard containers.](https://github.com/replicate/cog) 
- [Dreambooth API](https://replicate.com/blog/dreambooth-api)


## TODO

- [ ] process / makefile to build them
- [ ] schedulers?
- [ ] preprocess / input params should be per cog model
- [ ] safety_checker missing issues?
